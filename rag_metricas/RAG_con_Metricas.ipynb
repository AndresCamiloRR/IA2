            "Niels Bohr propuso un modelo atómico en 1913.  Su modelo postulaba que los electrones orbitan el núcleo atómico en niveles de energía cuantizados.  Esto significaba que los electrones sólo podían ocupar ciertas órbitas específicas, a diferencia de los modelos anteriores que permitían órbitas a cualquier distancia del núcleo.  Este concepto de cuantización de la energía fue un paso crucial en el desarrollo de la mecánica cuántica y explicaba, por ejemplo, el espectro de emisión del átomo de hidrógeno.  El modelo de Bohr, aunque posteriormente reemplazado por modelos más precisos, fue fundamental para comprender la estructura atómica y sentó las bases para desarrollos posteriores en la física cuántica.\n",
